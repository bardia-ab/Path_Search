    The returned function is specifically suitable for input to

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph.

    weight : string or function
        If it is callable, `weight` itself is returned. If it is a string,
        it is assumed to be the name of the edge attribute that represents
        the weight of an edge. In that case, a function is returned that
        gets the edge weight according to the specified edge attribute.

    Returns
    -------
    function
        This function returns a callable that accepts exactly three subLUT_inputs:
        a node, an node adjacent to the first one, and the edge attribute
        dictionary for the eedge joining those nodes. That function returns
        a number representing the weight of an edge.

    If `G` is a multigraph, and `weight` is not callable, the
    minimum edge weight over all parallel edges is returned. If any edge
    does not have an attribute with key `weight`, it is assumed to
    have weight one.
